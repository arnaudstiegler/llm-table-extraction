Left- and right-circle forms are accessible through the OpenType 'liga' font feature
of 'monogram-panhellenica.ttf'. 

The file 'monogram-panhellenica.ttf' contains *all* of the glyphs needed to typeset 
a circle monogram. The fallback fonts 'monogram-panhellenica-fallback-left.ttf' 
and 'monogram-panhellenica-fallback-right.ttf' should only be used if your creative 
software does not support OpenType font features.

To create a left-circle form, type a left parenthesis '(', followed by a capital letter. 
To create a right-circle form, type a capital letter, followed by a right parenthesis ')'.

Example: 

    '(ABC)'

will create a circle monogram with 'A' on the left, 'B' in the middle, and 'C' on the right. 

National flag icons can be used as the center glyph to render two-letter monograms. 

American flag: Dollar sign '$'
Canadian flag: Percent sign '%'
Pan-African flag: Number sign '#'

Example: 

    '(Χ$Ω)'

will create a circle monogram with the Greek letter 'Χ' on the left, an American 
flag in the middle, and the Greek letter 'Ω' on the right.

If left- and right-circle forms are not appearing, make sure that OpenType font features 
are enabled in your creative software.
