-----------------------

Archaz Negras strikes a chord with its rough rock band logo aesthetic. 
Its symmetric and captivating character makes it a fit for movie posters, Halloween invites, or a heavy metal t-shirt that demands attention. 
Dark, daring, and undeniably striking, Archaz Negras channels the raw energy of death metal and an eerie aura of horror. 
Designed with precision by Mans Greback, this destroyed font resonates with the rebellious spirit of punk and its haunting allure of the unknown. 

Write % after any word to make it symmetric. 
Example: Metal% 
(Download required.) 

Use { } [ ] < > around any word to give it wings.
