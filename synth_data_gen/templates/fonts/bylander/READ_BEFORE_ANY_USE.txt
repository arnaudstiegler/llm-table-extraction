Bylander is a stateful serif typeface. 
With robust, heavy letterforms reminiscent of a foundry's hammer hitting molten metal, and an unpaired weight, Bylander's characters seem forged from the core of the Earth.

Its rounded corners whisper tales of smoothened river stones, and its gentle curves combined with its industrial mass makes Bylander a paradox; both intimidating in its boldness and welcoming in its approach. This work stands as a testament to the art of typographical design, where contrasts coalesce into a harmonious dance. Bylander leaves an indelible impression â€“ heavy, yet refined; solid, yet fluid.

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and has a guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures, and more features; all to give you full control and customizability. It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from Northern Europe to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers.

Mans Greback is the prolific type designer behind Bylander. With an ability to capture the spirit of the times, Greback crafts fonts that are more than just alphabets; they are narratives, each telling a unique story. Drawing inspiration from the world around him and historical typographic traditions alike, Mans Greback has solidified his place as one of the luminaries in the ever-evolving world of typography.
