These are dingbat fonts with over 40 glyphs each of military jet aircraft.

Each glyph has a mirrored counterpart between the upper and lower cases (as well as the numerals/punctuation). Use of a character map program, such as Windows' Character Map, will be very helpful in exploring and using these fonts.

These fonts may be freely distributed and are free for all non-commercial uses.  

For commercial use of the font please visit http://iconian.com/commercial.html for additional information.
